        Ditch the drive thru and make some <strong>homemade Wendy’s Chili </strong> having to leave the house. Hearty, filling, and super easy to make, you won’t go back!
    </p>
    <p>
        There’s something absolutely delicious about a bowl of hot Wendy’s Chili. My family and I love chili. 
        <emp> Super comforting and a great easy to-to meal. </emp>
    </p>
    <p>

        It’s so tasty and filling and can be used as either a main dish, a side dish, or as a heavy appetizer. <br>
        It’s so versatile and I love that we can make a huge batch and have leftovers to enjoy for a few days.
