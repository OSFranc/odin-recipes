    <p>The most delicius dish across Latam, great for breakfast, lunch and dinner, no Salvadorean reunion could be complete without this flavorfull dish</p>
    <p>This is a fairly authentic version of the popular Salvadorean dish. It does take some time, however it is well worth the effort! <br>
        You can purchase pre-made chicharron at specialty markets, however this recipe tastes just like it. <br>
        I also make the salsa roja and curtido ahead of time (the salsa freezes very well, and the curtido can stay in the fridge at least a week).</p>
